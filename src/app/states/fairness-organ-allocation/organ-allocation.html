          <p><a href="http://www.unos.org/index.php" target="_blank">United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS)</a> is a national organization that manages the organ allocation process. UNOS manages the waiting list, organ transplant data and provides organ transplant education.</p>
          <p> Giving the gift of life through donation requires a great deal of teamwork between physicians, nurses, hospital staff, the Organ Procurement Organization (OPO) staff and transplant teams. The steps to successful organ donation can be found here: <a href="http://organdonor.gov/about/organdonationprocess.html" target="_blank">US Department of Health and Human Services: Organ Donation: the Process</a></p>
          <p>To learn more about the organ transplantation process, click on the following link: <a href="http://www.unos.org/donation/index.php?topic=organ_allocation" target="_blank">UNOS Organ Allocation Process</a></p>
          <p>The <a href="http://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/converge/latestData/step2.asp" target="_blank">wait time for a kidney</a> for African Americans is about 5 years. For whites the wait time is about 3.6 years. African Americans wait almost an additional 1.5 years as compared to whites.</p>
          <p>There’s a <a href="http://advancingyourhealth.org/transplant/2014/12/11/unos-kidney-allocation-system-changes/" target="_blank">UNOS policy</a> effective December 2014 that should help improve access to transplant for African Americans. Time on the waiting list is one of the factors that determines how quickly you receive an organ. Under the new policy, time spent on dialysis  (more African Americans are on <a href="http://www.diabetes.org/living-with-diabetes/treatment-and-care/transplantation/kidney-replacement-therapy.html" target="_blank">dialysis</a> than whites) is included in time spent on the waiting list. For African Americans on dialysis, this new policy is expected to allow them to receive organs sooner than before.</p>
          <p>After exploring this website and becoming informed about the facts, think about registering on your state website to give the most precious gift of all – the gift of life.</p>
