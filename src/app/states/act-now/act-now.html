          <p>There are more African Americans on the transplant list due to a variety of reasons. One reason is that African Americans more often have chronic diseases (like high blood pressure and diabetes).</p>
          <p>Did you know that the presence of high blood pressure in African Americans is among the highest in the world? High blood pressure affects more than 40% of African Americans. It <a href="http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/HighBloodPressure/UnderstandYourRiskforHighBloodPressure/High-Blood-Pressure-and-African-Americans_UCM_301832_Article.jsp">appears earlier</a> in African Americans than whites and is usually more severe. And, African Americans are <a href="http://pathology.jhu.edu/pc/PartAfAm.php?area=pa">nearly twice as likely as whites</a> to have diabetes mellitus.</p>
          <p>Another reason so many African Americans are waiting for a transplant is the limited number of African American donors. The kidney transplant matching process is very dependent on HLA (human lymphocyte antigens) matching. HLAs are proteins found in the blood that are inherited from one’s parents. The HLA markers in African Americans tend to be more mixed or varied than in whites; thus, the organs may be less compatible between donors and African American recipients.</p>
          <p>Organs that do not match well are more likely to be rejected and those that do match are less likely to be rejected. With the need for transplant so great in African Americans, one way to address the problem is to increase the number of African American donors.
